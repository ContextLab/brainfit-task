        The ad.html has a very specific format.

        Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

        The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
        the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
        your hit.

        The second part of the ad display after the person selected
        "Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
        ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
        open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
        server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

        See comments throughout for hints

To participate, you must be at least 18 years old, speak and read fluently in English, and have owned (and used) a Fitbit wearable device for at least the past 3 months. We will ask you for access to an anonymized snapshot of your Fitbit data (which requires logging into your Fitbit account via a secure portal) prior to beginning the main part of this study. We will then ask you some questions about your fitness habits and demographic information, and then we’ll ask you to take several short cognitive tasks. These games also require that you have working headphones or speakers. The task should take approximately 45 minutes to complete.  We will pay you $AMT for participating, plus up to $BONUSAMT additional determined from your performance in the cognitive tasks.
