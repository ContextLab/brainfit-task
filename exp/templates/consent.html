                        <p>Dartmouth College</p>
                        <p>Study Title: Learning and Memory </p>
                        <p>Principal Investigator: Jeremy Manning </p>
                    </centering>
                    <br />

                    <p><b><u>Introduction:</u></b> You are being asked to take part in a <u>research</u> study.  Taking part in research is <u>voluntary</u>.  You are being asked to take part in this study because you are a healthy adult.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p><b><u>What is the purpose of this study?</u></b></p>
                    <p>The purpose of the study is to investigate how people learn and remember.  We will use the data from this study to build theories about how memory works, and how memory changes under different conditions or circumstances.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p><b><u>Will you benefit from taking part in this study?</u></b></p>
                    <p>Should you decide to participate, there will be no personal benefit to you as a result of the experimental procedure.  Your participation will contribute to new knowledge pertaining to how people learn and remember.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p><b><u>What does this study involve?</u></b></p>
                    <p>During the experiment, you will be shown stimuli on a computer screen (e.g., words, or images of faces, scenes, or objects) and asked to perform simple tasks related to these stimuli (e.g. judging whether an image matches one that was presented previously or recalling which words you were shown earlier).  You will indicate your responses using the computer keyboard, mouse, or by speaking. Before each phase of the experiment, you will be given detailed instructions.  We expect the experiment to last approximately 20-30 minutes.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p><b><u>What are the options if you do not want to take part in this study?</u></b></p>
                    <p>There will not be any penalty or loss of benefits already entitled to you should you decide not to participate or to withdraw from the study.  Other healthy adult subjects can be found for our research purposes. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b><u>What are the risks involved with taking part in this study?</u></b></p>
                    <p>The risk of participating in this behavioral experiment is minimal.  Mild eye stress may be induced by extended viewing of a computer monitor.  We will encourage you to take breaks, as needed, throughout the experiment.</p>
                    <p><b><u>Other important items you should know:</u></b></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Leaving the study:</b> You may choose to withdraw from this study at any time and your withdrawal will have no effect on you academic or employment status. </li>
                    <li><b>Funding:</b> This research is funded by Dartmouth College.</li>
                    <li><b>Number of people in this study:</b> We expect approximately 500 people to enroll in this study in person (tested at Dartmouth College) and remotely (through a web application administered via Amazon Mechanical Turk).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p><b><u>How will your privacy be protected?</u></b></p>
                    <p>The information collected as data for this study includes your typed and spoken responses, and the times at which your responses were made.  Data gathered from this study will be maintained by the investigator for at least three years or as required by journal, federal, or state regulation. </p>
                    <p>Efforts will be made to protect your identity.  All information you provide will be kept con-fidential, except as governed by law.  All reasonable measures to protect confidentiality of your records and your identity will be taken.  Your identity will not be revealed in any pub-lications that result from this study.</p>
                    <p>We will employ randomly-assigned identification numbers to ensure that no personally identifying information is associated with your data.  All data will be encrypted and stored on a password- and firewall-protected server. </p>
                    <p>Any personal information you provide (e.g., your name, phone number, and email address) will be destroyed once the study has been completed, unless you provide written consent to be contacted by our lab at a future time regarding follow-up studies. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b><u>Will you be paid to take part in this study?</u></b></p>
                    <p>You may either earn T-points or money for participating in this study.  If you are a Dartmouth student enrolled in a Psychology course and are participating in this study for credit, you will receive 1/2 T-point for each 1/2 hour.  If you are participating in this study for money, you will receive $10 for each hour (rounded to the nearest 30 minutes).</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><b><u>Whom should you call with questions about this study?</u></b></p>
